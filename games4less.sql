This game features fighting entertainment with multi-tiered stages that are now both dynamic and critical parts of the competitive experience.\r\n\r\n[Story]\r\nThe story will follow that of Dead or Alive 5, shedding light on 2 main narratives; namely, the battle between ?Ninja and DOATEC? versus ?M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan?, and the tournament ?Dead or Alive 6?. New episodes will also be added for returning characters.\r\n\r\n[The New Visuals]\r\nThe visuals of DOA6 express dramatic lighting that goes beyond the genre of ?fighting games? and focus on serious, intense combat.

There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you\'d like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc.\r\nMYSTERY OF THE HOUSE\r\nThis house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn\'t any truth to any of it.\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\nIn Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster.\r\nPlay alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer.

Try different types of strategies to win.\r\n\r\nSingle Player Mode\r\nYou can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself.
